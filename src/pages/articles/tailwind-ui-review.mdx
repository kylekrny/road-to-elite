When it comes to personal projects there is always something that gets in the way. Whether it’s busy schedules, technical challenges or just lacking motivation. A few months ago, I decided to pull the trigger on the $299 tailwindUI license. I figured it would give me a library of nice looking components, helping me ramp up production speed. If you are looking to alevate the burden of writing responsive / tested css on your personal projects, tailwind UI might be for you.

## What is Tailwind and Tailwind UI

Tailwind CSS is an open-source utility-first css framework that utilizes preprocessors to help you rapidly build components. Aka Instead of having to write tons of css code in order to get your site to look good, it provides a bunch of utility classes such as `flex`, `bg-gray-600` and `rotate-90`.

Having been a bootstrap person most my professional career, my first question was what’s different to bootstrap? In short it’s the built in preprocessing. Tailwind CSS is very performant and very versatile. You can easily make a custom background color `bg-[#a5a5a5]` a custom font size `font-[10rem]`  or whatever else you need. In bootstrap I always found myself having to write some form of custom css in order to achieve the look I want. With tailwind, that’s never the case.

Tailwind UI is developed by the people who maintain Tailwind CSS, it is a library of prebuilt components and templates that you can use and modify for just about any project you can think of.

**Tailwind UI license does not allow people to build website generators with tailwind UI components, or sell / give away Tailwind UI components other than that carte blanche.**

## What is included for $299

First, You get access to all their components they have developed for life. They have a vast component library with everything you need to develop any type of site. Whether you need a pricing component for your marketing site, a dashboard for your app or an checkout page for your e-commerce store their is a component for it.

Second, you now get access to their tastefully crafted templates. From API documentation to personal portfolios (what this site is based off), they have you covered. The sites are simple and well built, fully responsive and easy to adjust and make something truly unique. 

## The real value

You are getting tested front end code written by the people who maintain Tailwind CSS. The way everything just fits, no matter what device you are viewing it on makes the development process move so quickly. No more having to write media queries to make things responsive, or having to get your grid layouts perfect.

The templates are written in Next.js an intuitive full stack framework that makes it easy to build APIs and other backend functionality into the site. The other beautiful part about utilizing Next.js is how easy it is to containerize. This allows for quick and fast deployments. I currently host my projects using Google Cloud Run allowing my projects to be hosted for pretty much free.


## Conclusion

Tailwind UI feels like cheating, from the rigorous amounts of CSS I haven written to make things perfect, Tailwind is a breeze. Due to how quickly I can spin up a site, with my personal tailwind / next boilerplate I use, I have been able to help friends with sites and projects that I would have never thought I would have time to do before. Their appreciation and amazement of how nice everything looks and functions makes it all worth it. 

While tailwind UI might have a hefty up front cost, I think the speed and velocity you are able to develop with is worth the price. Their  a few open source alternatives that I have worked with, I have found myself still touching some CSS but that could be worth the lower price.
